# console-ui 规格增量：编译样式发布契约

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Compiled global-style package boundary

The `console-ui` package MUST compile its Tailwind directives and `@apply` rules during package build and MUST expose the compiled stylesheet as `@moebius/console-ui/globals.css`.

The desktop renderer MUST consume the compiled package stylesheet and MUST NOT rely on Chromium to interpret Tailwind build directives.

The desktop renderer host stylesheet MUST remain limited to window/root hosting concerns and MUST NOT duplicate component layout, button, textarea, card, badge, sidebar, or composer styling owned by `console-ui`.

The desktop build MUST fail when its emitted renderer stylesheet still contains Tailwind build directives or does not contain representative `console-ui` utilities.

#### Scenario: Desktop renderer receives compiled component styles

- **GIVEN** the desktop renderer imports `@moebius/console-ui/globals.css`
- **WHEN** the desktop application is built
- **THEN** the emitted renderer stylesheet contains the component library token and utility styles
- **AND** it contains no `@tailwind` or `@apply` build directives.

#### Scenario: Desktop host CSS does not become a second component library

- **GIVEN** the desktop console page has a host stylesheet
- **WHEN** its selectors are inspected
- **THEN** it only establishes window/root hosting behavior
- **AND** component visual and layout rules remain owned by `console-ui`.
